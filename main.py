<div style="border:2px solid Gray;"><b><i>Instructions</i></b>: Problems are supposed to be worked in the assigned groups. Write the solution in the provided Google Colab notebook. Each Notebook should have the group name and the Week as its name. So, the name of the notebook for the second homework of the group 3 should be

**Group_3_Week_2.ipynb**

Submit one homework per group only! Post it in the same Google Directory that we have allocated for your group for the homeworks in Bootcamp and where you have found the file with the HW. The group can work on the file in the same google drive directory jointly.

Try to solve as many questions as you can and please play around and experiment. This is not a competition and you are not going to be issued a grade for this. If you do not know how to do something or you make mistake, do not worry, just try to figure out later how to do things.

If you submit it by the deadline we shall make sure to check and give you feedback. The feedback will be written in the same file that you leave in your Google Drive for the group.

You can use any resources available to you, other than collaborating with other groups. In particular, you are encouraged to use the Internet resources (to try to google the hints from thousands of users around the world) and, of course, you should use the lecture notes.

If you are an experienced programmer, make sure that less experienced programmers get to do as much as they can and to help them to learn. The same for the economists - help out your noneconomist friends learn related to concepts they may not know once thee need for that arises. Once you are done submit (one file per group). Above all, have fun!</div>

<font color='LightBlue ' style="font-size:25px"><b>Problem 1 - Design your notebook (Lecture 1)</b></font>

Find a text on the Internet. Copy it below this cell in the new text cell. Then try to format it in such a way that it looks as nice as possible. Break it down into paragraphs. Add a title and subtitles to it.  Use different colors and fonts, if you like. Also, try to import a picture and add some formulas in LaTex, just to practice.

We use Time Value of Money formula from [Investopedia](https://https://www.investopedia.com/) and its look alike: \begin{align}
        PV = \frac{FV} {(1+i)^n}
    \end{align}
Where:
PV=Present value (original amount of money) <p>FV=Future value</p> <p> <i>i</i>=Interest rate per period</p> <p> n=Number of periods </p>

In this problem we are going to practice working with lists.

In the  cell below you can find prices of the Amazon stock for the period Jul 2019-Jul 2020. They are stored in the list **prices**:

Often times in finance we need to deal with average quantities. 

Our task here is to compare average price for the whole sample and two subsamples (`prices`, `prices_1`, and `prices_2`, respectively). One way to do it is to find the sum of all stock prices in a list and divide it by the number of elements of that list.

Calculate the average stock price for the whole period (list `prices`) and compare it with the average stock prices with the first half of the period and the second half of the period.
